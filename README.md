This guide was created to support the **Linux Install Party (Party d’installation Linux)** held each semester to help new students get up and running with Linux - whether in a virtual machine or through dual-boot installation.

## Contents

- Step-by-step Linux installation instructions
- Setup for virtual machines (Windows/macOS)
- Dual-boot instructions and partitioning
- Troubleshooting common installation errors
- Secure boot, BitLocker, and Intel RST configuration
- Network setup (UQAM Wi-Fi)
- Printer configuration for UQAM systems
- Student-specific recommendations (e.g., Debian 12 for INF1070)
- Advanced configuration (VirtualBox Guest Additions, shell fixes, etc.)

## Before You Start

Make sure you:
- Back up your important data
- Have at least **20–30 GB of free space**
- Bring your **UQAM permanent code** and **Wi-Fi credentials** if on campus
- **Disable BitLocker** on Windows if it's enabled - this is necessary for dual boot setups.  *(See the [Guide](./Guide (EN).md#bitlocker) for instructions.)*

If unsure, attend the [Install Party](https://info.uqam.ca/linux/) for guided assistance!
